This website contains Matlab code for carrying out the analysis in the paper Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Betas: longitudinal feedback in multifactor asset pricing by Grassi and Violante (forthcoming). 
The soure are:  
   1) Application1.zip: contains the files to replicate the five dimensional forecasting exercise in Section 6.1
   2) Application2.zip: contains the files to replicate the twelve dimensional forecasting exercise in Section 6.2
   3) Simulation_Corollary2.zip: this is to replicate the results in simulation S1 in Section 5
   4) Simulation_Paper.zip: replicates the results in simulations S2 and S3 in Section 5
   5) SimulationExercise_Appendix.zip: replicates the results in the Appendix
